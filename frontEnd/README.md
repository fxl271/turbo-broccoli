Folder for the front end of the senior project.

It consists of a python file that will run Flask to host the HTML pages/

There should be 2 main pages
- a home page that allows for inputs to run the training
- a results page to show the results of training the model

In order to run the flask application use this command in the terminal:
	
`flask --app app run`

Additionally, add `--debug` at the end of the command to run in debug mode so that refreshing the page will load any changes to the code without having to restart the app.
